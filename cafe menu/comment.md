# My Web Development Journey

## Introduction

Hello, I'm a freshman majoring in data science and analytics at United States International University. I have a passion for building models and data analysis, and I also enjoy front-end development. This document outlines my journey as I worked on my first website page.

## Starting Point

I started my journey with resources from Free Code Camp. It's an amazing platform that provides hands-on experience and lessons on various aspects of web development.

## Learning HTML

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It was the first thing I learned on my journey. Here are some of the basics I learned:

- **Elements and Tags**: I learned about different HTML elements and their corresponding tags such as `<p>` for paragraphs, `<h1>` to `<h6>` for headings, and `<a>` for links.

- **Attributes**: I learned how to use attributes like `class`, `id`, and `src` to further define HTML elements.

## Learning CSS

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. Here are some of the basics I learned:

- **Selectors, Properties, and Values**: I learned how to select HTML elements and apply styles to them using properties and values.

- **Box Model**: I learned about the CSS box model and how it's used to design layout.


## Building My First Web Page

After learning the basics of HTML and CSS, I embarked on building my first web page. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience. I applied the concepts I learned and was able to see them come to life on the web page.

## Looking Forward

I look forward to working on more challenging tasks in the future. I plan to learn JavaScript next and start building interactive web pages. I'm excited about this journey and can't wait to see where it takes me!
